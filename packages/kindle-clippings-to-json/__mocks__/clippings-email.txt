After surviving a stint in the military, raising her boys, watching
countless buzzer-beating basketball games, and standing up to union bosses,
Kathryn decided she was not about to be intimidated by a bunch of harmless

first signs of a receding hairline or an expanding waistline.

The first dysfunction is an absence of trust among team members.
Essentially, this stems from their unwillingness to be vulnerable within
the group. Team members who are not genuinely open with one another about
their mistakes and weaknesses make it impossible to build a foundation for
trust. 2. This failure to build trust is damaging because it sets the tone
for the second dysfunction: fear of conflict. Teams that lack trust are
incapable of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate of ideas.
Instead, they resort to veiled discussions and guarded comments. 3. A lack
of healthy conflict is a problem because it ensures the third dysfunction
of a team: lack of commitment. Without having aired their opinions in the
course of passionate and open debate, team members rarely, if ever, buy in
and commit to decisions, though they may feign agreement during meetings.
4. Because of this lack of real commitment and buy-in, team members develop
an avoidance of accountability, the fourth dysfunction. Without committing
to a clear plan of action, even the most focused and driven people often
hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviors that seem
counterproductive to the good of the team. 5. Failure to hold one another
accountable creates an environment where the fifth dysfunction can thrive.
Inattention to results occurs when team members put their individual needs
(such as ego, career development, or recognition) or even the needs of
their divisions above the collective goals of the team. And so, like a
chain with just one link broken, teamwork deteriorates if even a single
dysfunction is allowed to flourish.

Another way to understand this model is to take the opposite approach=E2=80=

positive one=E2=80=94and imagine how members of truly cohesive teams behave=
: 1.
They trust one another. 2. They engage in unfiltered conflict around ideas.
3. They commit to decisions and plans of action. 4. They hold one another
accountable for delivering against those plans. 5. They focus on the
achievement of collective results. If this sounds simple, it=E2=80=99s beca=

to be protective or careful around the group. In essence, teammates must

Questions need not be overly sensitive in nature and might include the
following: number of siblings, hometown, unique challenges of childhood,
favorite hobbies, first job, and worst job. Simply by describing these
relatively innocuous attributes or experiences, team members begin to
relate to one another on a more personal basis, and see one another as
human beings with life stories and interesting backgrounds. This encourages
greater empathy and understanding, and discourages unfair and inaccurate
behavioral attributions. It is amazing how little some team members know
about one another, and how just a small amount of information begins to
break down barriers.

The key to making a 360-degree program work, in my opinion, is divorcing it
entirely from compensation and formal performance evaluation. Rather, it
should be used as a developmental tool, one that allows employees to
identify strengths and weaknesses without any repercussions. By being even
slightly connected to formal performance evaluation or compensation,
360-degree programs can take on dangerous political undertones.

The most important action that a leader must take to encourage the building
of trust on a team is to demonstrate vulnerability first. This requires
that a leader risk losing face in front of the team, so that subordinates
will take the same risk themselves. What is more, team leaders must create
an environment that does not punish vulnerability. Even well-intentioned
teams can subtly discourage trust by chastising one another for admissions
of weakness or failure. Finally, displays of vulnerability on the part of a
team leader must be genuine; they cannot be staged. One of the best ways to
lose the trust of a team is to feign vulnerability in order to manipulate
the emotions of others.

All great relationships, the ones that last over time, require productive
conflict in order to grow. This is true in marriage, parenthood,
friendship, and certainly business. Unfortunately, conflict is considered
taboo in many situations, especially at work. And the higher you go up the
management chain, the more you find people spending inordinate amounts of
time and energy trying to avoid the kind of passionate debates that are
essential to any great team.

It is also ironic that so many people avoid conflict in the name of
efficiency, because healthy conflict is actually a time saver. Contrary to
the notion that teams waste time and energy arguing, those that avoid
conflict actually doom themselves to revisiting issues again and again
without resolution. They often ask team members to take their issues

Another tool that specifically relates to conflict is the Thomas-Kilmann
Conflict Mode Instrument, commonly referred to as the TKI. It allows team
members to understand natural inclinations around conflict so they can make
more strategic choices about which approaches are most appropriate in
different situations.

The two greatest causes of the lack of commitment are the desire for
consensus and the need for certainty: =E2=80=A2 Consensus. Great teams unde=
rstand
the danger of seeking consensus, and find ways to achieve buy-in even when
complete agreement is impossible. They understand that reasonable human
beings do not need to get their way in order to support a decision, but
only need to know that their opinions have been heard and considered. Great
teams ensure that everyone=E2=80=99s ideas are genuinely considered, which =
then
creates a willingness to rally around whatever decision is ultimately made
by the group. And when that is not possible due to an impasse, the leader
of the team is allowed to make the call. =E2=80=A2 Certainty. Great teams a=
lso
pride themselves on being able to unite behind decisions and commit to
clear courses of action even when there is little assurance about whether
the decision is correct. That=E2=80=99s because they understand the old mil=

axiom that a decision is better than no decision. They also realize that it

As simple as it seems, one of the best tools for ensuring commitment is the
use of clear deadlines for when decisions will be made, and honoring those
dates with discipline and rigidity. The worst enemy of a team that is
susceptible to this dysfunction is ambiguity, and timing is one of the most
critical factors that must be made clear. What is more, committing to
deadlines for intermediate decisions and milestones is just as important as
final deadlines, because it ensures that misalignment among team members is
identified and addressed before the costs are too great.

In order for teammates to call each other on their behaviors and actions,
they must have a clear sense of what is expected. Even the most ardent
believers in accountability usually balk at having to hold someone
accountable for something that was never bought in to or made clear in the
first place.

One of the most difficult challenges for a leader who wants to instill
accountability on a team is to encourage and allow the team to serve as the
first and primary accountability mechanism. Sometimes strong leaders
naturally create an accountability vacuum within the team, leaving
themselves as the only source of discipline. This creates an environment
where team members assume that the leader is holding others accountable,
and so they hold back even when they see something that isn=E2=80=99t right=

A good way to make it easier for team members to hold one another
accountable is to clarify publicly exactly what the team needs to achieve,
who needs to deliver what, and how everyone must behave in order to
succeed. The enemy of accountability is ambiguity, and even when a team has
initially committed to a plan or a set of behavioral standards, it is
important to keep those agreements in the open so that no one can easily

If teammates are not being held accountable for their contributions, they
will be more likely to turn their attention to their own needs, and to the
advancement of themselves or their departments. An absence of
accountability is an invitation to team members to shift their attention to
areas other than collective results.

The ultimate dysfunction of a team is the tendency of members to care about
something other than the collective goals of the group. An unrelenting

But what would a team be focused on other than results ? Team status and
individual status are the prime candidates : =E2=80=A2 Team status. For mem=
bers of
some teams, merely being part of the group is enough to keep them
satisfied. For them, the achievement of specific results might be
desirable, but not necessarily worthy of great sacrifice or inconvenience.

organizations that come to believe that the nobility of their mission is
enough to justify their satisfaction. Political groups, academic
departments, and prestigious companies are also susceptible to this
dysfunction, as they often see success in merely being associated with
their special organizations.

 is an absence of trust among team members. Essentially, this stems from th=
eir unwillingness to be vulnerable within the group. Team members who are n=
ot genuinely open with one another about their mistakes and weaknesses make=
 it impossible to build a foundation for trust. 2. This failure to build tr=
ust is damaging because it sets the tone for the second dysfunction: fear o=
f conflict. Teams that lack trust are incapable of engaging in unfiltered a=
nd passionate debate of ideas. Instead, they resort to veiled discussions a=
nd guarded comments. 3. A lack of healthy conflict is a problem because it =
ensures the third dysfunction of a team: lack of commitment. Without having=
 aired their opinions in the course of passionate and open debate, team mem=
bers rarely, if ever, buy in and commit to decisions, though they may feign=
 agreement during meetings. 4. Because of this lack of real commitment and =
buy-in, team members develop an avoidance of accountability, the fourth dys=
function. Without committing to a clear plan of action, even the most focus=
ed and driven people often hesitate to call their peers on actions and beha=
viors that seem counterproductive to the good of the team. 5. Failure to ho=
ld one another accountable creates an environment where the fifth dysfuncti=
on can thrive. Inattention to results occurs when team members put their in=
dividual needs (such as ego, career development, or recognition) or even th=
e needs of their divisions above the collective goals of the team. And so, =
like a chain with just one link broken, teamwork deteriorates if even a sin=
gle dysfunction is allowed to flourish.</div><div>=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

e building of trust on a team is to demonstrate vulnerability first. This r=
equires that a leader risk losing face in front of the team, so that subord=

create an environment that does not punish vulnerability. Even well-intenti=
oned teams can subtly discourage trust by chastising one another for admiss=
ions of weakness or failure. Finally, displays of vulnerability on the part=
 of a team leader must be genuine; they cannot be staged. One of the best w=
