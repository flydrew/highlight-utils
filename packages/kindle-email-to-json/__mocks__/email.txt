TY, Lotus 123, DOS, and VHS are often cited as examples in this context. The=
 standards that do win may do so for a variety of other reasons: they build o=

sed by a community of gatekeepers who favored their use. Sometimes standards=
 win due to an outright conspiracy, as in the case of the gas refrigerator d=

    these dimensions of standards are in some sense idealized. They embody g=
oals of practice and production that are never perfectly realized, like Plat=
o=E2=80=99s triangles. The process of building to a standardized code, for e=
xample, usually includes a face-to-face negotiation between builder(s) and i=
nspector(s), which itself includes a history of relations between those peop=
le. Small deviations are routinely overlooked, unless the inspector is makin=
g a political point. The idiom =E2=80=9Cgood enough for government use=E2=80=
=9D embodies the common-sense accommodations of the slip between the ideal s=
tandard and the contingencies of practice.

    A definition of infrastructure =E2=80=A2 Embeddedness . Infrastructure i=

nse that it does not have to be reinvented each time or assembled for each t=
ask, but invisibly supports those tasks. =E2=80=A2 Reach or scope . This may=
 be either spatial or temporal=E2=80=94infrastructure has reach beyond a sin=

e taken-for-grantedness of artifacts and organizational arrangements is a si=
ne qua non of membership in a community of practice (Lave and Wenger 1991, S=
tar 1996). Strangers and outsiders encounter infrastructure as a target obje=
ct to be learned about. New participants acquire a naturalized familiarity w=
ith its objects as they become members. =E2=80=A2 Links with conventions of p=
ractice . Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the conventions of a c=
ommunity of practice; for example, the ways that cycles of day-night work ar=
e affected by and affect electrical power rates and needs. Generations of ty=
pists have learned the QWERTY keyboard; its limitations are inherited by the=
 computer keyboard and thence by the design of today=E2=80=99s computer furn=
iture (Becker 1982). =E2=80=A2 Embodiment of standards . Modified by scope a=
nd often by conflicting conventions, infrastructure takes on transparency by=
 plugging into other infrastructures and tools in a standardized fashion. =E2=
=80=A2 Built on an installed base . Infrastructure does not grow de novo; it=
 wrestles with the inertia of the installed base and inherits strengths and l=
imitations from that base. Optical fibers run along old railroad lines, new s=
ystems are designed for backward compatibility; and failing to account for t=
hese constraints may be fatal or distorting to new development processes (Mo=
nteiro and Hanseth 1996). =E2=80=A2 Becomes visible upon breakdown . The nor=
mally invisible quality of working infrastructure becomes visible when it br=
eaks: the server is down, the bridge washes out, there is a power blackout. E=
ven when there are backup mechanisms or procedures, their existence further h=
ighlights the now visible infrastructure. =E2=80=A2 Is fixed in modular incr=
ements, not all at once or globally . Because infrastructure is big, layered=
, and complex, and because it means different things locally, it is never ch=
anged from above. Changes take time and negotiation, and adjustment with oth=
er aspects of the systems involved. 7 Source: Star and Rohleder 1996.
